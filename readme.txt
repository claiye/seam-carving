Project Readme

This is a live seam carving app that allows the user to experience content-aware resizing through seam carving. 

The user must upload images from the computer and can make small changes to them (such as cropping and rotation) in the app as necessary before carving. In carving mode, the user sets the dimensions to which the image will be resized to by dragging a crop bar, then the app returns both a resized image and the original image with the seams that were carved highlighted in red. The user can choose to save the current edited image at any stage of the app, carved or not. There is also the option of reverting to the original uploaded image as well as uploading a new one. All of these functions can be accessed through the floating editor window that appears whenever a new upload is made. 

This app was designed for small to medium images. Uploading any large images is not recommended, as it will take too long to carve. Please keep dimensions below 700 for both horizontal and vertical. 

To run the app, simply run photoEditApp.py.
