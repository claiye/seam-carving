- created various new files with functions for each mode (crop, uploaded, home, carving, rotate)
	- mousePressed, keyPressed, redrawAll, and its various functions
	- home mode allows for upload of an image 
	- uploaded allows for the display of the uploaded image (and transferring to different editing modes) 
	- rotate mode successfully rotates image and displays it (but huge loss in quality of rotated pics) 

- created file photoEditApp, which, when ran, starts the app 
	- unites all the different “modes” of the app and calls the correct functions 

- seamCarving contains the algorithm for deleting a set number of seams 
	- added function allowing for finding one specific seam and carving it out 
	- added function that recalculates the energy of all affected pixels after a particular seam is carved out 
	- wrapped in larger, overall function which allows for the seam carving algorithm to run a number of times, deleting however many seams 
	- successfully tested on small 30x30 image 

- floatingWindow is the editor 
	- so far only exists as a separate floating window, functions yet to be added
